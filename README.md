# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The mechanism in which this goal is achieved is via a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).


## Running Files
2.Inside the /home/workspace directory run the command `python churn_library.py`

3.In order to test the code, inside the /home/workspace directory run the command `pytest churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`
